World Map Selector {data-orientation=rows}
=====================================

Row {data-height=600}
-------------------------------------

### World Map

```{r, echo = FALSE}

  leafletOutput("map1")

  output$map1 <- renderLeaflet({
    leaf_world_etf
  })
```

Row {data-height=400}
-------------------------------------

### Country ETF

```{r, echo = FALSE}

dygraphOutput("dygraph")
  
  # A reactive that captures the name of the country clicked. 
  # Note that it captures the id of the shape that was clicked, 
  # when we built our leaflet map in the DataGrab Notebook 
  # we prepared for this and assigned 'id = name' so we could capture
  # the name of the country upon a click

  clickedCountry <- eventReactive(input$map1_shape_click, {
     return(input$map1_shape_click$id)
     })
   
  output$dygraph <- renderDygraph({
    
    # The next line is a crucial line of code. This is wherein our map and our dygraph intersect.
    # We pass the name of the country that was clicked to the list of xts objects in order
    # to extract the ETF for the clicked country. Then we pass that to dygraphs.
    stock1 <- getSymbols(as.character(clickedCountry()), auto.assign = FALSE)

    dygraph(Cl(stock1), main = clickedCountry())  %>%
      
      # A range selector comes in handy for zooming to the start date for each ETF.
      
      dyRangeSelector(height = 20) %>%
      
      ##add shading for the recession from December 2012 to June 2009
