This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Ironically, the most time consuming part of this Notebook was getting the ticker symbols and country
# names into a single list and cleaned up so we could pass that list to getSymbols,
# and eventually build a nice list for our flexdashboard. 
# Get used to this and, ideally, start to love it! Just getting the data into a nice format
# can be frustrating but once you wrestle with this step, you'll find that you know your data
# backwards and forwards. 

Global_ETF_symbols <- read_excel("symbols.xlsx")

#Global_ETF_symbols$Inception <- ymd(Global_ETF_symbols$Inception)

Global_ETF_symbols$Country <- gsub("iShares|MSCI|ETF|capped|currency|hedged|large-cap|all|min|vol|small-cap|adaptive|edge|\\b\\w{1,2}\\s|^\\s+|\\s+$", "", Global_ETF_symbols$Country, ignore.case = TRUE)
#Global_ETF_symbols$Country <- gsub("^\\s+|\\s+$", "", Global_ETF_symbols$Country)

# Rename a few countries to match their naming convention on the leaflet map

Global_ETF_symbols$Country[47]<-"United Arab Emirates"
Global_ETF_symbols$Country[7] <- "Korea"

# Looks like there's an extra row - let's remove that. 

Global_ETF_symbols<-Global_ETF_symbols[-65, ]

```

```{r, warning = FALSE}
library(quantmod)
#library(PerformanceAnalytics)

getSymbols(Global_ETF_symbols$Symbol, auto.assign = TRUE, warnings = FALSE)

# think about the different start dates, or just live with the 2007 and map it

etf_prices <- do.call(merge, lapply(Global_ETF_symbols$Symbol, function(x) Cl(get(x))))

# We want the column names to be countries so we can synch this up with the world map. Let's
# make that change by using the 'Country' column from our original ETF data 
# (another benefit of all that work we did with gsub to clean up the column)

colnames(etf_prices) <- Global_ETF_symbols$Country

# Get rid of the duplicative ETFs - that is, the countries that have more than one ETF. 
# Why? We want one ETF per country and in come cases iShares has multiple 
# ETFs for a country. Normally we wouldn't just get rid of the duplicates, we would have a reason
# for keeping one or the other or all of them, but for this example the blunt instrument is fine.
# It will also makes things smoother if we wish to join this data to our spatial data frame in the 
# future. 

etf_prices_single_country <- etf_prices[, !duplicated(colnames(etf_prices))]
